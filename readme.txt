This is a bus station program .Firstly,you enter to the home page where you choose to either login as a Client ,a Manager or a driver.
If you login as a manager you can either choose to view all trips or to assign trips to the driver or logout .When you view all trips you can add or cancel a trip
by searching its ID and you can edit the ticket price.While if you login as a driver you can view your name ,assigned trips which are assigned by the  manager or logout.
However if you login as a client you can search for a trip ,view your schedule or logout.Search, you search for trips to book(add) by entering the pickup location 
and whether thetrip is internal or external then you get to see all the trips present with there details for your chosen pickup location .
As a Client you can also view your scheduled trips so that if you want to cancel any of your booked trips by searching for the ID .We handled all the errors that 
may appear to the user such as entering a wrong username or password or searching for a trip that isnot present etc...In addition we also added a sign up feature 
for users who havenot used the application before to create a new account and login.We made files to all of the drivers, customers ,managers and trips  and
to access any of the trips in all these files we only use the trip ID to get all the remaining info for this trip.
